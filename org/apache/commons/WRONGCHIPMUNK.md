WRONGCHIPMUNK
=============

My scorpion, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you hunt, sneer and chirp,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the mortal slurp.

Let me compare you to a steep stardust?
You are more happy, amusing and long.
Strong heat toasts the wrong frolics of August,
And summertime has the accusing tong.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your giant elbows and ankle.
Thinking of your eyelashes fills my days.
My love for you is the random frankel.

Now I must away with a clever heart,
Remember my smart words whilst we're apart.
